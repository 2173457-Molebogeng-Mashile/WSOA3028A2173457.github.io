                <h1>As it has been thought.</h1>

                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered what people in the 40s would think if they saw the world we live in today? How would they have imagined what the future would look like. Do we live up to their expectations?
                    <br /><br />
                    In in 1945, Vannevar Bush, gave his prediction on what people in this day and age would be doing with technology. While he was the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Bush wrote an essay that gave amazingly similar descriptions of inventions that exist today.
                    Though he these descriptions are not of specific machines we use today, they do share the same ideas on what they should be use for. For example, "One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments.
                    Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together." Bush states that he imagines a future where information is easily recorded. This concept is executed in multiple ways today such as using your phone to record notes for you to listen to later. Another prediction was how machines would process information for us.
                    �Whenever logical processes of thought are employed � that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove � there is an opportunity for the machine.� We rely on our phones and computers to do a wide range of tasks for us. We consider them as an extension of ourselves. Though I imagine his idea was aimed at specific work-related tasks, we have exceeded it to be included in our daily lives.
                    <br /><br />
                    People in his day might have read his work and think of it as inventions take only technologically advanced aliens whereas to the average person today, these inventions are taken for granted and not considered to be something to get excited over. Whether or not Bush's essay was the inspiration for the inventions that exist today, we'll never really know. However, it is interesting to see how far we've come and where we are going.
