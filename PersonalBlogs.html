                <h2>Punk is not dead</h2>


                <p>
                    With the rise of the punk movement of the 70s, there wasn't any space for people of colour to express their radical views and behaviors as the white people did.  In 2003, the short film Afro-punk, produced by Matthew Morgan and directed by James Spooner, inspired many black youths to create

                    their own ways to express themselves. Afro punk is the celebration of the alternative arts scene in black communities. With afro-punk came afro punk fashion. This style a mixture of the dark and edgy with the coolness of African culture. The South African afro-punk scene

                    is blossoming. With the annual Afro-punk festival held in Johannesburg, people are encouraged to push fashion boundaries and embrace their heritage. I personally don't have this type of edge in me, but to see so many africans feeling free to explore this of themselves is truly inspiring.

                <h1>Converse</h1>
                <h2>The Pantsula way of life</h2>

                <p>
                    Pantsula is more than a style of dance or a style of dress, it has become part of South African pop culture. From the early 90s, the Panstula style has always been easily recognisable. From the bucket hat to the heavy-duty workwear. However, a key staple in Panstula culture is the converse sneakers.

                    Available in a multitude of colors, prints and patterns, they are considered to be a classic touch to any Pantsula attire. The Pantsula way of life was always been the epitome of cool. I was a huge  kwaito fan growing up. I used to listen to Trompies on the radio and jump around
                    like a fool. I remember thinking that all it took was a pair of converse and I could be just like them.  Obviously just wearing converse doesn't make you Pantsula. It takes more than that. The attitude. The swag. Not everyone can pull it off, I certainly couldn't.
                    It's sad to see such an importent part of South African history fading.
                    I think everyone needs atleast one pair of converse in their closet, if not for yourself, then to honor the pantsula culture.

                <p>
                    Staring her career as a fashion blogger, Lumala slowly made her way into the South African Art scene. She became quite popular for her intriguing fashion sense and dominated African fashion. Lulama has a strong supporter of South African

                    designers and African artists. She is now blazing her own trail in the arts. Her thought-provoking contemporary pieces have been making waves in the industry. Lulama Wolf has always inspired me to not let any boundaries stop me from achieving my dreams.

                    I find her career journey quite interesting and would definitely recommend you keep an eye on her as well.
