                This week theory speaks about the prediction of the the internet. In The Library of babel by Jorge Luis Borges, We are shown a universe where everything has already been written.
                Every worrd or sentence has already been thought of. Much like the internet of today , this library allows to search for anything and it will give you an answer. This library has a unique design
                that caters to what the reader serches. In theGarden of Forking paths, aslo by Jorge Luis Bogres, we are given a story with infinite endings. Each path the reader takes in the story is unique and leads to another.
                In the essay As we may thinhk by Vannevar Bush, we see a sort of prediction on what the internet and what it caould be. Vannevar Bush shares what he would like to the future to have in terms of technology. These readings
                can all be compared to what the internet is today. We have infinite amounts of information available to us that is accesible using the relevent technology.
