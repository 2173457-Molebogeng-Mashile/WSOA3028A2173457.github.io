                <p>
                    Data does away. It's just not the data you want. There have been countless incidences where important data has been lost forever. NASA has lost the tape masters of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon,  Myspace lost all it's uploaded content and Vine (R.I.P) seems like it's has been wiped of the face of the earth.

                    And now with the recent death of Yahoo Answers, it is becoming clear that it definitely is possible to have our precious memories erased.

                    <br /><br />

                    It seems as if all the permanent stuff relates to the embarrassing and cringe worthy content the younger thought was cool. All the memes and celebrity

                    scandals you can probably find, no matter which internet era they are from. “We’re just going to be digital refugees forever,” says archivist Jason Scott in the New York Times. We are running from one site to another losing things as we go. With new social media platforms rising every few years, we can never be

                    sure of who will be the next to go. Will it be Facebook? With its decreasing popularity. Snapchat? Do you really need it anyway? TikTok seems to be main center of attention at the moment. Its addictive design is stealing someone else's shine. It's just a matter of time before they completely disappear.

                    <br /><br />

                    We as a society, believe that the internet is forever and that is partly true. You should still be careful of what you share online because it could come back to haunt you. It takes large teams of engineers to manage all this data and at the end of the day, humans will make mistakes. With all the music lost from  Myspace

                    caused by human error, we can conclude that nothing on the internet is really forever.

                <p>
                    Communication is characterized as any trade of data, thoughts, convictions, perspectives, or sentiments. Every day we perform some form of communication, whether oral, physical, emotional or even digital. It is impossible to escape the messages all around you. One has the right

                    to express their opinions through public discourse, through the press and media or through other means. Freedom of speech is one of the most basic rights that every human being should have, however it is not available to everyone. We tend to think we live in a free world and are naïve

                    to how we are manipulated on a daily basis. With more and more people on social media, it has become more difficult to control content produced by the public.

                    <br /><br />

                    The Web has expanded worldwide correspondence, human collaboration, and access to information. It has additionally been viewed as an incredible development in advancing opportunity of discourse through the world.  Nonetheless, there have been concerns

                    about what freedom of speech on the internet would to us as a society. To begin with, a few nations have expressed that freedom of speech on the internet could damage the political structure. Are we giving people to much power?

                    <br /><br />

                    With different people commenting on the same issue, we will get different opinions. It is often the negative information that reaches a broader audience. There more people are aware of certain political and social issues, there more pressure added to governments to change their policies as seen in the Xinjiang

                    genocide. The Chinese government is under enormous pressure to better govern the nation. However, there has been a desperate spread of propaganda from the Chinese government insisting that there is no genocide. Although their attempt is failing, it is interesting to see what kind of information those in political power are able to

                    force down the public's throat. It raises the question of what other major false information is promoted by our leaders and how much of it we believe.
