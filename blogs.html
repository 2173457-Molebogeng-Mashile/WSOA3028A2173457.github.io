                <h1>As it has been thought.</h1>

                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered what people in the 40s would think if they saw the world we live in today? How would they have imagined what the future would look like. Do we live up to their expectations?
                    <br /><br />
                    In in 1945, Vannevar Bush, gave his prediction on what people in this day and age would be doing with technology. While he was the Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Bush wrote an essay that gave amazingly similar descriptions of inventions that exist today.
                    Though he these descriptions are not of specific machines we use today, they do share the same ideas on what they should be use for. For example, "One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments.
                    Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together." Bush states that he imagines a future where information is easily recorded. This concept is executed in multiple ways today such as using your phone to record notes for you to listen to later. Another prediction was how machines would process information for us.
                    “Whenever logical processes of thought are employed — that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove — there is an opportunity for the machine.” We rely on our phones and computers to do a wide range of tasks for us. We consider them as an extension of ourselves. Though I imagine his idea was aimed at specific work-related tasks, we have exceeded it to be included in our daily lives.
                    <br /><br />
                    People in his day might have read his work and think of it as inventions take only technologically advanced aliens whereas to the average person today, these inventions are taken for granted and not considered to be something to get excited over. Whether or not Bush's essay was the inspiration for the inventions that exist today, we'll never really know. However, it is interesting to see how far we've come and where we are going.

                <h1>Web 2.0.</h1>

                <p>
                    Those born in the 2000s probably have no idea of how far the World Wide Web has come. The internet has evolved immensely since it was created. In the 90s, we saw the rise of the internet. It became increasingly popular and more developed in the early 2000s, however, it wasn’t the same internet we have today.
                    <br /><br />
                    We are now in the second stage of development of the internet called the web 2.0. The web 2.0 is commonly referred to as the social web. This stage of development is easier to use and is designed for the user. We no longer have static webpages but rather dynamic ones.  Static webpages are less complex. They only present data that the developer has made available. They do not allow for the browser or the user to make changes. Dynamic webpages on the other hand, are more flexible and can be changed to suit the user's needs. They require complex design and development. They manage information that is constantly changing the more it is used. This information can range from detailed search results to weather updates in a specific location. Static webpages do not adjust to the user's needs.
                    <br /><br />
                    The web 2.0 has also given rise to the use of social media. Social media allows users to create content that are relevant to them and share it with others. Although social media is not considered to be safest place to share your information as you are left vulnerable to negative opinions and being spied on, it has become nearly impossible to be exposed to. The web 2.0 has given freedom in the way we use the internet, however, it is also uncontrollable and unpredictable.

                <h1>The medium is the message</h1>

                <p>
                    In a world where there are numerous ways to communicate, we tend to pick and choose which medium is appropriate to share our message. Where can you share your opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement? Where can you share pictures of special moments in your life? Where you present your opinion can affect how it is received.
                    <br /><br />
                    There needs to be a medium for us to deliver a message. Canadian philosopher, Marshall McLuhan, characterizes a medium as an extension of ourselves. Due the daily use of technology such as phones and laptops, people have become dependent on them. They have become a part of our existence today and with this comes our consumption of Digital Media. From social media, emails and websites, each one of these platforms is used to communicate specific information. As McLuhan said, “In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message.” We tend to have different attitude and mannerisms when using different medium. The characteristics of the medium determine how we communicate. For example, emails tend to be more formal, whereas Instagram and other forms of social media are more informal and not taken seriously by your audience. Each medium has their own personal and social consequences that affect how we communicate.
                    <br /><br />
                    New ways of communicating often change our cultures and how we interact with the world. There have concerns about our decreasing physical interactions due to the increasing digital media. With new forms of digital media every few years, we cannot predict what communication will look like in the future.

                <h1>Hypertext</h1>

                <p>
                    With hypertext, the reader is able to choose which path they would like the text to follow. It creates a connection between texts continues the flow of information. There have been disagreements of what the linked information is meant to do.
                    <br /><br />
                    The literary community believe that hypertext is meant to act as way to transport you from one position in the text to another separate text. The reader chooses how they want a story to unfold. The text often depends on these hypertexts to continue one message or story. The tech community on the other hand, believe that hypertext is meant to connect information. Hypertext acts as an extension of the original text and cannot be separated. It is extra information provided to give the reader more knowledge on the original text. Both sides make solid arguments, however, they both define hypertext relative to the type of texts they produce and do not give a general definition.
                    <br /><br />
                    Theodore Nelson defines hypertext as, "A body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." His definition only excludes hypertext in the physical form. Physical hypertext often become too complicated for the reader to follow. Hypertext in the digital form has branched in a wide variety of media from video games and movies to e-books and journals. Hypertext is linking information and have the reader choose how and where to read it.

                <h1>Are we not being innovative enough? </h1>

                <p>
                    The digital space is basically an imitation of the physical world. Are not thinking outside the box? Should we be using Hypermedia in more innovative ways?
                    <br /><br />
                    The technological advancements present today were influence by how we interact with the real world. The word document, for example, is used similarly to how we use paper. They follow the same structure and conventions. This could be that we imitate the physical world not to change how it is used, but for convenience. Doing things digitally is easier than doing then manually. Ordering in rather than going to the restaurant yourself is much easier and less time consuming. However, some might say we can be more imaginative with the world. Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu challenges the use of hypermedia. Hypermedia is the linking of different content to one another and being able to move between the as we choose. Ted Nelson claims that we are not uses the digital space to its full potential, and so he created Xanadu.
                    <br /><br />
                    Xanadu is a hypertext medium that allows the reader to explore multiple sources of information at the same time. It is presented in a digital 3D space. The reader can move freely in this space. When the reader selects a piece of text, a corresponding one is aligned next to it to allow the reader to read the connections or references by simply scrolling to it. Project Xanadu is still in development and it very exciting to see this type of innovation in hypertext, however, whether it will make it harder or easier for users to navigate through the text is still uncertain.

                <h1>The meaning of design </h1>

                <p>
                    Was it difficult for you to get here? Did you struggle to find this piece of text you're reading right now? If so, it's not your fault. There are plenty of infuriating bad designs that one experiences on a day-to-day basis. Why is that still happening?
                    <br /><br />
                    Perhaps you found your way here just fine. I'm sure this isn't your first time on a webpage. You know how it works. This webpage is pretty straightforward, at least that's what the person who designed it thinks. Assuming you did struggle, you would have read the bold text written in a large font size or the colourful buttons to help you explore the page. As Fitts’ Law states, "The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance and size of the target". The elements on this page are supposed to ensure easy navigation.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are some systems designed to for you to struggle and figure out on your own. For example, exploration games and puzzle games or even machines such as cell phones. You are not given all the information you need to use them. They either follow conventions or try to get to learn own your own. There should always be a purpose in design. When systems are unclear, users become frustrated and are less likely to return.

                <h1>Webpage layouts.</h1>

                <p>
                    Most webpages have a modular layout. This layout makes the page easier to follow as it leads our eyes in the downward direction as we do when we read on paper. We have become comfortable with this style of flow in webpages as ones that do not follow this convention take longer to analyse.
                    <br /><br />
                    Effective communication is the goal of any digital media. A webpage with the same goal as others will have the same navigation. The search bar will always be located at the top of the page. A shopping cart will be at top right side of the page. Modular page layouts were developed over centuries of trial and error. They conducted scientific research and studied advertising culture to come up with a system that understands the reader. With the rise of digital media, new studies are conducted as it there are new behaviors to reading text online instead of on paper. It is found that people generally will not read the entire text on a webpage.
                    <br /><br />
                    The modular layout allows the reader to easily find what they are looking for. Developers are constantly trying to find ways to get readers to their websites and to get them to come back and using a easily recognizable layout seems to be the answer.
