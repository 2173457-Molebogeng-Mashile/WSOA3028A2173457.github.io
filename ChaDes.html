                <p>
                    Naledi Chiloane is a 28-year-old fashion blogger living in Johannesburg South Africa.
                    Naledi grew up in the rural village of Mapulaneng in Mpumalanga. Due to her mother working as a domestic worker and being away for weeks at a time,
                    her and her two siblings were raised by her grandmother.
                    Naledi has very fond memories of her childhood and will always have a deep respect for her mother because of the sacrifices she made for her children.
                    <br /><br />
                    Her mother worked for a very wealthy family and whenever she would return, she would always come bearing gifts (usually old junk the family didn't want anymore).
                    She remembers receiving her first fashion magazine. It was love at first site. After that she knew she wanted to work with clothes.
                    <br /><br />
                    Fast forward to her university days, Naledi arrived at The University of Johannesburg ready to take on the world. 
                    In her third year she discovered she had no spark for mechanical engineering and decided to go after what she really wants. Fashion.
                    It was very difficult for her in the beginning. She didn't know where to start or what she was really going to do for a living,
                    however many years later, with the rising of the internet and many friends she had made along the way, she was able to become a full-time fashion blogger. 
                    Now she spends her days running around the city looking for the next big thing in the South African fashion scene so she can tell the rest of the world about it.
